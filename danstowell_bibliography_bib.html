  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) power is affected by weather conditions, making the power generated from the PV systems uncertain. Solving this problem would help improve the reliability and cost effectiveness of the grid, and could help reduce reliance on fossil fuel plants. The present paper focuses on evaluating predictions of the energy generated by PV systems in the United Kingdom Gaussian process regression (GPR). Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian non-parametric model that can provide predictions along with the uncertainty in the predicted value, which can be very useful in applications with a high degree of uncertainty. The model is evaluated for short-term forecasts of 48 hours against three main factors -- training period, sky area coverage and kernel model selection -- and for very short-term forecasts of four hours against sky area. We also compare very short-term forecasts in terms of cloud coverage within the prediction period and only initial cloud coverage as a predictor. }

  abstract = {Monitoring wildlife is an important aspect of conservation initiatives. Deep learning detectors can help with this, although it is not yet clear whether they can run efficiently on an embedded system in the wild. This paper proposes an automatic detection algorithm for the Bela embedded Linux device for wildlife monitoring. The algorithm achieves good quality recognition, efficiently running on continuously streamed data on a commercially available platform. The program is capable of computing on-board detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with an AUC score of 82.5% on the testing set of an international data challenge. This paper details how the model is exported to work on the Bela Mini in C++, with the spectrogram generation and the implementation of the feed-forward network, and evaluates its performance on the Bird Audio Detection challenge 2018 DCASE data.}

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) is an increasingly significant fraction of electricity generation. Efficient management, and innovations such as short-term forecasting and machine vision, demand high-resolution geographic datasets of PV installations. However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66 GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93 GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.}

However, their direct computation is time-consuming and rigid, motivating the development of more efficient algorithms. Here we introduce a description of a method to compute visibility graphs online, which is highly efficient, compatible with batchwise progressive updates, and capable of assimilating new data without having to recompute the graph from scratch. We use a binary search tree to encode and store visibility relations, which can be decoded at a later stage into a visibility graph. The proposed encoder/decoder approach offers an online computation solution at no additional computational cost and makes it possible to use visibility graphs for large-scale time series analysis and for applications where online data assimilation is required.}

Reverberation can have a detrimental effect on such machine-to-machine signals while decoding. Various methods have been studied to combat the effects of reverberation in speech and audio signals, but it is not clear how well they generalise to other sound types. We look at extending these models to facilitate machine-to-machine acoustic signalling. This research investigates dereverberation techniques to shortlist a single-channel reverberation suppression method through a pilot test. In order to apply the chosen dereverberation method a novel method of estimating acoustic parameters governing reverberation is proposed. The performance of the final algorithm is evaluated on quality metrics as well as the performance of a real machine-to-machine decoder. We demonstrate a dramatic reduction in error rate for both audible and ultrasonic signals.}

  abstract = {A typical audio signal processing pipeline includes multiple disjoint analysis stages, including calculation of a time-frequency representation followed by spectrogram-based feature analysis. We show how time-frequency analysis and nonnegative matrix factorisation can be jointly formulated as a spectral mixture Gaussian process model with nonstationary priors over the amplitude variance parameters. Further, we formulate this nonlinear model's state space representation, making it amenable to infinite-horizon Gaussian process regression with approximate inference via expectation propagation, which scales linearly in the number of time steps and quadratically in the state dimensionality. By doing so, we are able to process audio signals with hundreds of thousands of data points. We demonstrate, on various tasks with empirical data, how this inference scheme outperforms more standard techniques that rely on extended Kalman filtering.}

Thus the automatic recognition of individuals by sound is a potentially powerful tool for zoology and ecology research and practical monitoring. Here, we present a general automatic identification method that can work across multiple animal species with various levels of complexity in their communication systems. We further introduce new analysis techniques based on dataset manipulations that can evaluate the robustness and generality of a classifier. By using these techniques, we confirmed the presence of experimental confounds in situations resembling those from past studies. We introduce data manipulations that can reduce the impact of these confounds, compatible with any classifier. We suggest that assessment of confounds should become a standard part of future studies to ensure they do not report over-optimistic results. We provide annotated recordings used for analyses along with this study and we call for dataset sharing to be a common practice to enhance the development of methods and comparisons of results.}

  abstract = {In audio signal processing, probabilistic time-frequency models have many benefits over their non-probabilistic counterparts. They adapt to the incoming signal, quantify uncertainty, and measure correlation between the signal's amplitude and phase information, making time domain resynthesis straightforward. However, these models are still not widely used since they come at a high computational cost, and because they are formulated in such a way that it can be difficult to interpret all the modelling assumptions. By showing their equivalence to Spectral Mixture Gaussian processes, we illuminate the underlying model assumptions and provide a general framework for constructing more complex models that better approximate real-world signals. Our interpretation makes it intuitive to inspect, compare, and alter the models since all prior knowledge is encoded in the Gaussian process kernel functions. We utilise a state space representation to perform efficient inference via Kalman smoothing, and we demonstrate how our interpretation allows for efficient parameter learning in the frequency domain.}

As a result, source separation GP models have been restricted to the analysis of short audio frames. We intro- duce an efficient application of GPs to time-domain audio source separation, without compromising performance. For this purpose, we used GP regression, together with spectral mixture kernels, and variational sparse GPs. We compared our method with LD-PSDTF (positive semi-definite tensor factorization), KL-NMF (Kullback-Leibler non-negative ma- trix factorization), and IS-NMF (Itakura-Saito NMF). Results show that the proposed method outperforms these techniques.}

Such representation inherently captures the harmonic content of the signal whilst being resilient to broadband noise. We present experiments demonstrating its utility to measure robust similarity between harmonic signals in real and synthesised audio data. The source code is available online.}

  abstract = {Assessing the presence and abundance of birds is important for monitoring specific species as well as overall ecosystem health. Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge showing that with modern machine learning including deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data --- with no manual recalibration, and no pre-training of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% AUC (area under the ROC curve), much higher performance than previous general-purpose methods. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. }

Even though the parameter k appears to be key for a successful separation, little discussion on its influence or optimisation can be found in the literature. Here we propose a novel method, based on graph theory statistics, to automatically optimise k in a vocal separation task. We introduce the k-NN hubness as an indicator to find a tailored k at a low computational cost. Subsequently, we evaluate our method in comparison to the common approach to choose k. We further discuss the influence and importance of this parameter with illuminating results.}

Probabilistic latent variable analysis can be particularly insightful, but existing approaches don’t incorporate prior knowledge about the physical behaviour of amplitude envelopes, such as exponential decay or feedback. We use latent force modelling, a probabilistic learning paradigm that encodes physical knowledge into Gaussian process regression, to model correlation across spectral subband envelopes. We augment the standard latent force model approach by explicitly modelling dependencies across multiple time steps. Incorporating this prior knowledge strengthens the interpretation of the latent functions as the source that generated the signal. We examine this interpretation via an experiment showing that sounds generated by sampling from our probabilistic model are perceived to be more realistic than those generated by comparative models based on nonnegative matrix factorisation, even in cases where our model is outperformed from a reconstruction error perspective.}

Different bird monitoring methods have been developed over the years, but surveys based on

possible method is automatic acoustic monitoring, which can supplement standard bird-monitoring
schemes.
We investigated the automatic detection of migrant birds’ night flight calls. Long-term recordings
were collected during birds’ autumn migration along the Baltic Sea coast. A deep learning method,
convolutional neural network working on spectrograms, was adapted to detect the migrants’ calls.
The first results are promising (AUC=96.6%), showing the potential of acoustic methods to
supplement standard bird-monitoring techniques and to suggest a directions for research.},

  abstract = {Latent force models are a Bayesian learning technique that combine physical knowledge with dimensionality reduction — sets of coupled differential equations are modelled via shared dependence on a low-dimensional latent space. Analogously, modal sound synthesis is a technique that links physical knowledge about the vibration of objects to acoustic phenomena that can be observed in data. We apply latent force modelling to sinusoidal models of audio recordings, simultaneously inferring modal synthesis parameters (stiffness and damping) and the excitation or contact force required to reproduce the behaviour of the observed vibrational modes. Exposing this latent excitation function to the user constitutes a controllable synthesis method that runs in real time and enables sound morphing through interpolation of learnt parameters.},

In this work, we introduce a technique that using a two step process can first automatically detect all bird vocalizations and then, with the use of ‘weakly’ labelled recordings, classify them. Evaluations of our proposed method show that it achieves a correct classification of 75.4% when used in a synthetic dataset.}

  abstract = {Real music signals are highly variable, yet they have strong statistical structure. Prior information about the underlying physical mechanisms by which sounds are generated and rules by which complex sound structure is constructed (notes, chords, a complete musical score), can be naturally unified using Bayesian modelling techniques. Typically algorithms for Automatic Music Transcription independently carry out individual tasks such as multiple-F0 detection and beat tracking. The challenge remains to perform joint estimation of all parameters. We present a Bayesian approach for modelling music audio, and content analysis. The proposed methodology based on Gaussian processes seeks joint estimation of multiple music concepts by incorporating into the kernel prior information about non-stationary behaviour, dynamics, and rich spectral content present in the modelled music signal. We illustrate the benefits of this approach via two tasks: pitch estimation, and inferring missing segments in a polyphonic audio recording. }

Individual birds can recognise familiar individuals from calls, but where in the signal is this identity encoded? We studied the question by applying a combination of feature representations to a dataset of jackdaw calls, including linear predictive coding (LPC) and adaptive discrete Fourier transform (aDFT). We demonstrate through a classification paradigm that we can strongly outperform a standard spectrogram representation for identifying individuals, and we apply metric learning to determine which time-frequency regions contribute most strongly to robust individual identification. Computational methods can help to direct our search for understanding of these complex biological signals.}

However, such devices may record more than an animal's vocal behavior, and have the potential to be used for investigating specific activities (movement) and context (background) within which vocalizations occur. To facilitate this approach, we investigate the automatic annotation of such recordings through two different sound scene analysis paradigms: A scene-classification method using feature learning, and an event-detection method using probabilistic latent component analysis. We analyze recordings made with Eurasian jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in both captive and field settings. Results are comparable with the state of the art in sound scene analysis; we find that the current recognition quality level enables scalable automatic annotation of audio logger data, given partial annotation, but also find that individual differences between animals and/or their backpacks limit the generalization from one individual to another. we consider the interrelation of “scenes” and “events” in this particular task, and issues of temporal resolution.}

We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that “kernels” reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individual’s effect on itself, its partner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of influences by call type as well as by individual.}

  abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and “unsupervised”, meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on “supervised” tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, classified using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that in our classification tasks, MFCCs can often lead to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data from which they are derived. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain. However, for one of our datasets, which contains substantial audio data but few annotations, increased performance is not discernible. We study the interaction between dataset characteristics and choice of feature representation through further empirical analysis.}

  abstract = {Birdsong often contains large amounts of rapid frequency modulation (FM). It is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic environment and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis or linear prediction. Hence, it is important to consider high-resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird vocalizations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a further advantage as large data sets become available.
    We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a signal at very short time-scales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus, we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures the species signal encoded in birdsong. We evaluate this through a feature selection technique and an automatic classification experiment. In order to find tools useful in practical analysis of large data bases, we also study the computational time taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3 compression.
    We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM attributes and can be applied to large data sets, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas bandwidth features do not encode additional information.
    FM analysis can extract information useful for bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterize vocalizations. Further, it can be applied efficiently across very large data sets and archives.},

The dataset recorded for this purpose is presented, along with the performance metrics that are used to evaluate the algorithms and statistical significance tests to compare the submitted methods. We use a baseline method that employes {MFCCs}, {GMMs} and a maximum likelihood criterion as a benchmark, and only find sufficient evidence to conclude that three algorithms significantly outperform it. We also evaluate the human classification accuracy in performing a similar classification task. The best performing algorithm achieves a mean accuracy that matches the median accuracy obtained by humans, and common pairs of classes are misclassified by both computers and humans. However, all acoustic scenes are correctly classified by at least some individuals, while there are scenes that are misclassified by all algorithms.}

  abstract = {In musical performances with expressive tempo modulation, the tempo variation can be modelled as a sequence of tempo arcs. Previous authors have used this idea to estimate series of piecewise arc segments from data. In this paper we describe a probabilistic model for a time-series process of this nature, and use this to perform inference of single- and multi-level arc processes from data. We describe an efficient Viterbi-like process for MAP inference of arcs. Our approach is score-agnostic, and together with efficient inference allows for online analysis of performances including improvisations, and can predict immediate future tempo trajectories.

  abstract = {Technologies such as YouTube, mobile phones and MP3 players are increasingly integrated into secondary school music in the UK. At the same time, the gap between formal and informal music learning is being bridged by the incorporation of students’ preferred music into class activities. We conducted an ethnographic study in two secondary schools in London, investigating the roles of technology in the negotiation of musical concepts in music classes. From this, we report some observations on the relation between formal/informal and authorised/unauthorised activities in class, and some specific observations on the role of YouTube, mobile phones and MP3 players in the class context. In the lessons we observed, these technologies functioned as part of a richly multimodal ecosystem of technologies, combining aspects of formal and informal use. This carries implications for how we plan for the use of technology in the delivery of music education.}

The effect can in principle be derived from any rhythmic template, producing patterns with aspects of fractal self-similarity. Any attempt to use it compositionally must address the difficult issue of scheduling events (notes, beats) and structural changes in a way that integrates with the multi-layered self-similar rhythmic structure. In this paper we develop an approach to scheduling rhythms, melodies and structural changes over a Risset accelerando (or decelerando) framework. We derive the mappings which allow note sequences and sample playback to be incorporated. We discuss some compositional choices available within this framework, and demonstrate them via audio examples.},

Timbre is a multidimensional attribute with interactions between dimensions, and the control and synthesised signals typically represent sounds with different timbral ranges, so it is non-trivial to design a search process which makes best use of the timbral variety available in the synthesiser. We first discuss our preliminary work applying standard machine-learning techniques for this purpose (PCA, self-organising maps), and the reasons they were not satisfactory. We then describe a novel regression-tree technique which learns associations between unlabelled multidimensional timbre distributions.

In this article we propose a novel approach to resolving the tension between the needs for low-latency reaction and reliable classification, by deferring the final classification decision until after a response has been initiated. We introduce a new dataset of annotated human beatbox recordings, and use it to study the optimal delay for classification accuracy. We then investigate the effect of such delayed decision-making on the quality of the audio output via a MUSHRA-type listening test. Our results show that the effect depends on the output audio type: for popular dance/pop drum sounds the acceptable delay is on the order of 12--35 ms.

  volume = {40},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Applications such as concatenative synthesis (audio mosaicing) and query-by-examplerequire the ability to search a database using a sound which is qualitatively different from the actual desired result -- for example when using vocal queries to retrieve nonvocal sound. Standard query techniques such as nearest neighbours do not account for this difference between source and target; they perform retrieval but do not learn to make timbral analogies. This paper addresses this issue by considering timbral query as a multivariate regression problem from one timbre distribution onto another. We develop a novel variant of multivariate tree regression: given only a set of unlabelled and unpaired samples from two distributions on the same space, the regression learns a cross-associative mapping which assumes general similarities in structure of the two distributions, yet can accommodate differences in shape at various scales. We demonstrate the technique with a synthetic example and with a concatenative synthesiser.

  abstract = {We consider the task of inferring associations between two differently-distributed and unlabelled sets of timbre data. This arises in applications such as concatenative synthesis/ audio mosaicing in which one audio recording is used to control sound synthesis through concatenating fragments of an unrelated source recording. Timbre is a multidimensional attribute with interactions between dimensions, so it is non-trivial to design a search process which makes best use of the timbral variety available in the source recording. We must be able to map from control signals whose timbre features have different distributions from the source material, yet labelling large collections of timbral sounds is often impractical, so we seek an unsupervised technique which can infer relationships between distributions. We present a regression tree technique which learns associations between two unlabelled multidimensional distributions, and apply the technique to a simple timbral concatenative synthesis system. We demonstrate numerically that the mapping makes better use of the source material than a nearest-neighbour search.

In this paper we discuss quantitative and qualitative approaches which provide opportunities to evaluate the music-making interaction, accounting for aspects which cannot be directly measured or expressed numerically, yet which may be important for participants. We present case studies in the application of a qualitative method based on Discourse Analysis, and a quantitative method based on the Turing Test. We compare and contrast these methods with each other, and with other evaluation approaches used in the literature, and discuss factors affecting which evaluation method(s) are appropriate in a given context.

However, rigorous qualitative methods do exist and can be used to investigate such topics. We present a methodology based around user studies involving Discourse Analysis of speech.

The procedure involves normalising the magnitude of each bin according to a recent maximum value for that bin, with the aim of allowing each bin to achieve a similar dynamic range over time, which helps mitigate against the influence of spectral roll-off and strongly-varying dynamics. Adaptive whitening requires no training, is relatively lightweight to compute, and can run in real-time. Yet it can improve onset detector performance by more than ten percentage points (peak F-measure) in some cases, and improves the performance of most of the onset detectors tested.

We present results demonstrating that adaptive whitening can significantly improve the performance of various STFT-based onset detection functions, including functions based on the power, spectral flux, phase deviation, and complex deviation measures. Our results find the process to be especially beneficial for certain types of audio signal (e.g. complex mixtures such as pop music).
